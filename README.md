### Featured Projects

- **[Neural Network Study](https://github.com/brend/neural-network-study)**: I made this to learn about how neural networks work, and it turns out that even a simple one can do many amazing things.
- **[FrameByFrame](https://github.com/brend/FrameByFrame)**: A stop-motion video creation studio for hobby use that met with some success back when it came out for OSX.
- **[Ray Tracer](https://github.com/brend/raytracer)**: This ray tracer can render scenes made up of geometric objects, directional lighting, and perspective projection. Written completely in Swift and featuring parallelized ray computation.
- **[Diffusor](https://github.com/brend/diffusor25)**: A macOS application for exploring various image processing algorithms, e.g. smoothing, edge enhancement or coherence enhancement.
- **[Nonograms](https://github.com/brend/Nonograms)**: An editor and solver for [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) puzzles (think Nintendo's Picross). Related: [SudokuBrute](https://github.com/brend/SudokuBrute), a program that solves Sudoku puzzles. <img src="https://github.com/brend/Nonograms/blob/master/resources/peacross-main.png" width="256" style="display: block;" alt="screenshot of the nonogram solving application">
- **[Lissajous Curve Table](https://github.com/brend/lissajous)**: A program that renders a Lissajous curve table. Teaches trigonometry and is aesthetically pleasing! <img style="display: block;" width="256" src="https://github.com/brend/lissajous/blob/main/assets/lissajous.gif" alt="animation of the application rendering a Lissajous table">
